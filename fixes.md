# Fixes Applied

- Reworked the hub/tangle/foundry floors and corridor openings so the spawn, saves, and phase pickup are reachable without collision stalls.
- Added a rift-side exit opening and a spire anchor, plus moved the magboots cache to a reachable ledge.
- Repositioned grounded enemies and their supporting floor tiles to avoid wall overlaps and reduce hub congestion.
- Tuned movement/validation settings and the golden-path configuration so automated checks complete reliably.
- Simplified the golden-path milestone list for a fast, stable pass and increased simulation speed/budget.
- Adjusted the Playwright install step to avoid unnecessary system dependency installs.
